High level attack and finding maps for all your penetration testing, hacking, bug bounty and red teaming needs! To be more specific, this is a collection of Finding/Vulnerability/Attack Path/Exploit Mind Maps meant to assist in more findings, better vulnerability chains and a clearer path of how and where to test, look and leverage what you're encountering during an engagement.

## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/GainSec/LunchBox 

Or click through the repo via GitHub's GUI!

### Map Key

* Yellow is starting point
* Red is the Finding/Vulnerability/Exploit
* Any parenthesis are relevant parameters, or other information to note

### Prerequisites

* Select Finding Map based on what vulnerabilities you've already found in order to find ways to chain findings
