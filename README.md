![LUNCHBOCKS](https://gainsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/L.U.N.C.H.B.O.C.K.S.png)

High level attack and finding maps for all your penetration testing, hacking, bug bounty and red teaming needs! To be more specific, this is a collection of Finding/Vulnerability/Attack Path/Exploit Mind Maps meant to assist in more findings, better vulnerability chains and a clearer path of how and where to test, look and leverage what you're encountering during an engagement.

## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/GainSec/LunchBox 

Or click through the repo via GitHub's GUI!

### Map Key

* Yellow is starting point
* Red is the Finding/Vulnerability/Exploit
* Any parenthesis are relevant parameters, or other information to note

### Prerequisites

A target and knowledge on how to leverage these finding maps

## To Do

* Create seperate folders for each type of offensive cyber security engagement
* Create seperate view based on phase and step of each type of engagement
* Create seperate view based on what piece is targeted (For example: By Request Headers, By Response, By Parameter Fuzzing)
* Add a brief description, overview, note or other relevant information to each mind map finding
* Add a link to tool, wordlist, example or similar to each mind map finding

## Example and How To

* Navigate to where your testing is starting from such as unauthenticated
* Select Finding Map based on what you're seeing in the response or output
* Select Finding Map based on what your looking to find
* Select Finding Map based on what vulnerabilities you've already found in order to find ways to chain findings
